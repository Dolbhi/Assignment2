                <h1>Historical Bushfires in Australia</h1>
                <p>
                    Bushfires in Australia are not a new development, Australia's dry climate means it contains some of
                    the most fire-prone regions in the world. Here bushfires have been a
                    widespread and regular occurance for millions of year and plays a key role in shaping the
                    environment, with many plants evolving to take advantage of land cleared by fires.
                    <br> <br>
                    However, in the modern day, out of control bushfires can cause great damage to property and person,
                    and with climate change giving rise to more extreme weather, the delicate balance of burning and
                    regrowth may be in danger of tipping.

                <h2>Bushfires Throughout The Year</h2>
                <p>
                    The frequency and intensity of bushfires is dependent on the weather. While bushfires can occur all
                    year round, fire risk tends to increase during the hotter summer month near the start and end of the
                    year. In truth, there is no formal "bushfire season" shared across the whole of Australia and the
                    exact period of greatest fire activity varies from region to region.
                    <br> <br>
                    Typically, the colloquial use of "bushfire season" applies mainly to southern and eastern Australia
                    when uncontrolled fires start occuring as early as June and may continue to occur into April.

                <h3><i>1938-39</i>: Black Friday Bushfires</h3>
                <p>
                    The Black Friday fires were the third deadliest on record, with some 71 people killed and 650 houses
                    destroyed. They followed years of drought and a series of
                    extreme heatwaves that were accompanied by strong northerly winds, after a very dry six months.
                    Melbourne hit 45.6 °C
                    and Adelaide 46.1 °C. In NSW, Bourke suffered 37 consecutive days above 38 degrees and Menindee hit
                    a record 49.7°C on 10 January.
                    <br> <br>
                    Planned burning was first introduced as a response to this.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>1966-67</i>: Black Tuesday</h3>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 1967, Tasmania suffered its most destructive fire season, and Australia's fourth
                    most deadly on record.
                    A verdant spring had added higher than usual fuel to the state's forest floors, and strong northerly
                    winds and high
                    temperatures drove at least 80 different fires across the south-east, burning to within 2 kilometres
                    (1.2 mi) of the
                    centre of Hobart, the state capital. The infernos killed 62 people and destroyed almost 1,300 homes.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>1980-83</i>: Ash Wednesday</h3>
                <p>
                    On 16 February 1983, about 180 fires in an event known as the Ash Wednesday bushfires caused
                    widespread destruction
                    across parts of South Australia and Victoria, burning an area of 3.74 million acres (1.51 million
                    hectares; 15,100 square
                    kilometres; 5,840
                    square miles) of bushland and exceeding the loss of 75 people. The bushfires, caused by years of
                    severe drought and extreme weather, were amongst the deadliest bushfires in Australian history.

                <h3><i>2003</i>: Canberra bushfires</h3>
                <p>
                    During 18-22 January 2003, almost 70% of the Australian Capital Territory's (ACT) pastures, pine
                    plantations, and nature
                    parks were severely damaged, and most of the Mount Stromlo Observatory was destroyed. Fires entered
                    the suburbs of
                    Canberra on 18 January 2003 and, in the following ten hours, four people died and over 490 were
                    injured 470 homes were
                    destroyed or severely damaged.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>2008-09</i>: Black Saturday</h3>
                <p>
                    Melbourne's maximum temperature was above 43.0 °C for three consecutive
                    days for
                    the first time since records had been kept, accompanied by strong winds on 7 February 2009, later to
                    be known as 'Black
                    Saturday'—precipitated major bushfires throughout Victoria, involving several large fire complexes,
                    which continued to
                    burn across the state for around one month. 173 people died in these fires and 414 were injured.
                    3,500+ buildings were
                    destroyed, including 2,029 houses, and 7,562 people displaced. In terms of loss of life and property
                    damage, the Black
                    Saturday fires rank as the most devastating in Australian history.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>2019-20</i>: The Hottest Year</h3>
                <p>
                    2019 had been the hottest record year for Australia, with the
                    bushfire season starting
                    in June 2019. This caused massive damage throughout the country, with fires in each state and
                    territory. The east coast
                    experienced widespread destruction from mega-blazes, such as the Currowan bushfire, which was just
                    one of many
                    catastrophic bushfires during the 2019-2020 season. In terms of the area of land burnt, wildlife
                    deaths, and damage to
                    the environment, some of its permanent damage, such as the burning of remnant rainforest.

                    The annual European Backpacker Index, compiled by priceoftravel.com, is designed to help money-savy
                    travellers find the cheapest European cities and plan an accurate budget for when they visit.
                    <br> <br> Prices for most things like hostels, transportation and attractions are fixed and certain.
                    However, prices for a 'budget lunch' or a pint of beer can vary depending on where you go. The index
                    takes all of these factors into
                    account to calculate the approximate price of a day in each city, including an overnight stay at a
                    backpacker hostel.
                    <br> <br> Here we review the top five cheapest European cities, as featured on the 2018 Index.
