                <p>
                    Did you know? It's hot during the summer. Yeah, really. No, I'm serious go outside and check right
                    now... what do you mean it's raining?
                    <br> <br>
                    Not only that, but bushfires also happen in bushes (and forests)! Bushes have wood so they count
                    as woody vegetation. Okay, you have done enough reading, you do not need to look into the remaining
                    text, yup, no need at all.
                    <br> <br>
                    Prices for most things like hostels, transportation and attractions are fixed and certain.
                    However, prices for a 'budget lunch' or a pint of beer can vary depending on where you go. The index
                    takes all of these factors into
                    account to calculate the approximate price of a day in each city, including an overnight stay at a
                    backpacker hostel.
