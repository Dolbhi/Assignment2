                <h1>Historical Bushfires in Australia</h1>
                <p>Wow bushfires, they sure do happen. Crazy right? Bushfires have been a part of the Australian
                    enviroment for
                    millions of years, eucalyptus are literally evolved to firemax</p>

                <p>
                    Did you know? It's hot during the summer. Yeah, really. No, I'm serious go outside and check right
                    now... what do you mean it's raining?
                    <br> <br>
                    Not only that, but bushfires also happen in bushes (and forests)! Bushes have wood so they count
                    as woody vegetation. Okay, you have done enough reading, you do not need to look into the remaining
                    text, yup, no need at all.
                    <br> <br>
                    Bushfires happen when hot and dry, especially if it's hot and dry bushes (or trees), yeah, bushfire

                    Yes it's climate change again. Bushfires happen alot over the years and are only increasing as
                    temperatures rise and the climate becomes drier.

                <h3><i>1938-39</i>: Black Friday Bushfires</h3>
                <p>
                    The Black Friday fires were the third
                    deadliest on record,
                    with some 71 people killed and 650 houses destroyed. They followed years of drought and a series of
                    extreme heatwaves
                    that were accompanied by strong northerly winds, after a very dry six months. Melbourne hit 45.6 °C
                    and
                    Adelaide 46.1 °C. In NSW, Bourke suffered 37 consecutive days above 38 degrees and
                    Menindee hit a record 49.7°C on 10 January.
                    <br> <br>
                    Planned burning was invented because of this
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>1966-67</i>: Black Tuesday</h3>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 1967, Tasmania suffered its most destructive fire season, and Australia's fourth
                    most deadly on record.
                    A verdant spring had added higher than usual fuel to the state's forest floors, and strong northerly
                    winds and high
                    temperatures drove at least 80 different fires across the south-east, burning to within 2 kilometres
                    (1.2 mi) of the
                    centre of Hobart, the state capital. The infernos killed 62 people and destroyed almost 1,300 homes.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>1980-83</i>: Ash Wednesday</h3>
                <p>
                    On 16 February 1983, about 180 fires in an event known as the Ash Wednesday bushfires caused
                    widespread destruction
                    across parts of South Australia and Victoria, burning an area of 3.74 million acres (1.51 million
                    hectares; 15,100 square
                    kilometres; 5,840
                    square miles) of bushland and exceeding the loss of 75 people. The bushfires, caused by years of
                    severe drought and extreme weather, were amongst the deadliest bushfires in Australian history.

                <h3><i>2003</i>: Canberra bushfires</h3>
                <p>
                    During 18-22 January 2003, almost 70% of the Australian Capital Territory's (ACT) pastures, pine
                    plantations, and nature
                    parks were severely damaged, and most of the Mount Stromlo Observatory was destroyed. Fires entered
                    the suburbs of
                    Canberra on 18 January 2003 and, in the following ten hours, four people died and over 490 were
                    injured 470 homes were
                    destroyed or severely damaged.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>2008-09</i>: Black Saturday</h3>
                <p>
                    Melbourne's maximum temperature was above 43.0 °C for three consecutive
                    days for
                    the first time since records had been kept, accompanied by strong winds on 7 February 2009, later to
                    be known as 'Black
                    Saturday'—precipitated major bushfires throughout Victoria, involving several large fire complexes,
                    which continued to
                    burn across the state for around one month. 173 people died in these fires and 414 were injured.
                    3,500+ buildings were
                    destroyed, including 2,029 houses, and 7,562 people displaced. In terms of loss of life and property
                    damage, the Black
                    Saturday fires rank as the most devastating in Australian history.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>2019-20</i></h3>
                <p>
                    2019 had been the hottest record year for Australia, with the
                    bushfire season starting
                    in June 2019. This caused massive damage throughout the country, with fires in each state and
                    territory. The east coast
                    experienced widespread destruction from mega-blazes, such as the Currowan bushfire, which was just
                    one of many
                    catastrophic bushfires during the 2019-2020 season. In terms of the area of land burnt, wildlife
                    deaths, and damage to
                    the environment, some of its permanent damage, such as the burning of remnant rainforest.
