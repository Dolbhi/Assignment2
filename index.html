                <h1>Historical bushfires in Australia</h1>
                <p>
                    Bushfires in Australia are not a new development, Australia's dry climate means it contains some of
                    the most fire-prone regions in the world. Here bushfires have been a
                    widespread and regular occurance for millions of year and plays a key role in shaping the
                    environment, with many plants evolving to take advantage of land cleared by fires.
                    <br> <br>
                    However, in the modern day, out of control bushfires can cause great damage to property and person,
                    and with climate change giving rise to more extreme weather, the delicate balance of burning and
                    regrowth may be in danger of tipping.
                    <br> <br>
                    Below is a map of the distribution of bushfires that have occured since 1900 up to today.

                <h2>Causes and factors</h2>
                <p>
                    Many fires have man-made causes such as electrical arcing, cigerettes or sparks from machinary.
                    However, in recent times, most major fires have started from dry lightning igniting fires in remote
                    regions.
                    <br> <br>
                    On the other hand, the intensity and severity of fires depends on how much dry fuel is avaliable to
                    it. While bushfires can occur all year round, Fires then to be more ferocious in hotter drier
                    conditions thus making them more widespread in the
                    summer or in what is typically refered to as "bushfire season". In truth, there is no formal
                    definition for a bushfire season shared across the whole of Australia and the
                    exact period of greatest fire activity varies from region to region.
                    <br> <br>
                    Typically, the colloquial use of "bushfire season" applies mainly to southern and eastern Australia
                    when uncontrolled fires start occuring as early as June and may continue to occur into April.

                <h2>Impact of bushfires</h2>
                <p>
                    As climate change brings about hotter and more extreme weather, bushfires in recent years have
                    become more intense and frequent. In addition to the direct damages to life and property, the smoke
                    released by bushfires can adversely affect the respiratory system of infants. This in turn results
                    has a significant economic impact in the funds spent on reconstruction, firefighting and healthcare.
                    <br> <br>
                    Wildfires also directly kill fauna and flora and destroy their habitats, posing significant risk to
                    hundreds of already endangered species. Even for animals that are capable of outrunning or burrowing
                    to hide from the blaze tend to suffer high numbers of causalties when doing so. Additionally, forest
                    fires release a large amount of CO2, far more than can be reabsorbed by the forest and fires become
                    hotter and more common.

                <h3><i>1938-39</i>: Black Friday</h3>
                <p>
                    Following years of drought and a series of extreme heatwaves, the 1939 bushfire season was one of
                    the worst on record. Multiple fires that had been burning throughout December linked together on
                    January Friday 13 in the third deadliest fire on record, totalling 71 deaths and 650 houses
                    destroyed.
                    <br> <br>
                    As a response to the devestating blaze, recommendations were brought forward to improve forest and
                    fire management resulting in planned burning becoming offical practice.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>1966-67</i>: Black Tuesday</h3>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 1967, Tasmania suffered its most destructive fire season, and Australia's fourth
                    most deadly on record. A verdant spring had added higher than usual fuel to the state's forest
                    floors, and strong northerly winds and high temperatures drove at least 80 different fires across
                    the south-east, burning to within 2 kilometres of the centre of Hobart. The
                    infernos killed 62 people and destroyed almost 1,300 homes.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>1980-83</i>: Ash Wednesday</h3>
                <p>
                    Another series of severe droughts and extreme weather over serveral years led to about 180 fires on
                    16 February 1983, in an event known as the Ash Wednesday bushfires caused widespread destruction
                    across parts of South Australia and Victoria, burning an area of 1.51 million of bushland and
                    killing over 75 people.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>2003</i>: Canberra bushfires</h3>
                <p>
                    From 18-22 January 2003, almost 70% of the Australian Capital Territory's pastures, pine
                    plantations, and nature parks were severely damaged, and most of the Mount Stromlo Observatory was
                    destroyed. Fires entered the suburbs of Canberra on 18 January 2003 and, resulting in 4 deaths, 490
                    injuries and 470 homes destroyed or damaged.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>2008-09</i>: Black Saturday</h3>
                <p>
                    In Melbourne, for the first in in record, the maximum temperature exeeded 43.0 Â°C for three
                    consecutive days, accompanied by strong winds on 7 February 2009, resulted in major bushfires
                    throughout Victoria, involving several large fire complexes, which continued to burn across the
                    state for around a month. 173 people died and 414 were injured with 3,500+ buildings were destroyed.
                    In terms of loss of life and property damage, the Black Saturday fires rank as the most devastating
                    in Australian history.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3><i>2019-20</i>: The Hottest Year</h3>
                <p>
                    2019 had been the hottest record year for Australia, with the bushfire season starting in June 2019.
                    This caused massive damage throughout the country, with fires in each state and territory. The east
                    coast experienced widespread destruction from mega-blazes, such as the Currowan bushfire, which was
                    just one of many catastrophic bushfires during the 2019-2020 season. In terms of the area of land
                    burnt, wildlife deaths, and damage to the environment, including the burning of remnant rainforest,
                    the 2019-20 fires were the worst in Australian history.
